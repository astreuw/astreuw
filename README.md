# Hello, friend.

I'm Ricardo, also known as *astreuw*, just another guy that doesn't understand computers. I am mainly interested in math (trying), chemistry, art and obviously computing. In my daily life using a computer I'm a Rubyist, but also a Python developer. Currently learning about C/C++ and x86 Assembly. My main language is Portuguese, but I also speak English and learning Deutsch.

If you want to know more about how do I organize my things, please read [my setup settings](https://github.com/astreuw/astreuw/setup.md).

I also like to write about what I've been learning and poetry, so if you want to read some cool stuff, [visit my blog](https://astreuw.github.io).
